# Tea Cozy Project

A practice website for the fictional company, The Tea Cozy. 

## Description

Made this to practice and show my CSS and HTML ability. Additionally I practiced basic Flexbox in my CSS for the first time in this project. This is all front-end work. All of this is just CSS and HTML.
